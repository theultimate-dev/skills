# Model family notes

Reviewed 2026-09-16, except sections that give their own review date. Model behaviour changes between releases; verify against the provider's current model page before relying on any line here. Apply these adjustments only when the user named the target model or family. Otherwise the enhanced prompt stays neutral and the report says so.

## Claude, current generation

Observed at review on Claude Fable 5.1, Fable 5, Opus 5, Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5, Sonnet 4.6, and Haiku 4.5.

- Explicit instructions with motivation and modifiers work best. The models follow instructions literally, so say exactly what to do and, when "above and beyond" is wanted, ask for it.
- Dial aggressive language back. Prompts written to stop earlier models under-triggering ("CRITICAL: you MUST use this tool when…") now over-trigger; "Use this tool when…" is enough.
- A prefilled last assistant turn is rejected on Claude 4.6 and later. Use direct instructions, output tags, or structured outputs instead.
- Thinking is adaptive or always on, and its depth is an effort setting. Skip "think step by step", put no thinking budget wording in the prompt, and list the depth choice under Outside the prompt. Manual `<thinking>` tags only where thinking is off, and then prefer thinking on at a low effort level.
- "Before you finish, verify against [criteria]" helps on most of these models; see Opus 5 for the exception.
- Long inputs first, question last. Three to five examples in `<example>` tags.
- Independent tool calls run in parallel by default; a one-line nudge raises the rate further.
- Subagents are used readily; where that is excessive, say when delegation is and is not warranted.

## Claude Opus 5.5

Reviewed 2026-09-29. From Anthropic's Opus 5.5 prompting guide, What's new page, migration guide, announcement, and system card, and the best-practices page that covers it. Anthropic says Opus 5 prompts should perform well unchanged and the Opus 5 patterns remain a reasonable starting point, and also that instructions tuned for Opus 5 may no longer be needed. Apart from update-cadence instructions, no source confirms an Opus 5 adjustment for Opus 5.5.

What changes from Opus 5:

- Thinking is always on; turning it off or setting a manual budget is rejected. Effort is the control, its default is `medium` (Opus 5 defaults to `high`), level names do not carry over between models, and at a given level it tends to think more per turn than Opus 5, most at `xhigh` and `max`. Under Outside the prompt: set effort explicitly after a sweep, reserve `xhigh` and `max` for measured gains, leave room in `max_tokens` (128,000 worked for long agentic coding turns), and change effort per message rather than per request to keep the cache.
- For less thinking, lower effort before adding prompt text; it works more reliably. If time to first token still matters at `low`, a system-prompt line such as "Answer directly without deliberating." can reduce thinking further; measure quality, since less thinking can lower it.
- In chat system prompts, consider removing lines that tell it to think carefully before answering; in Anthropic's chat testing, replies started sooner with no clear loss of quality. To curb re-thinking of earlier answers on follow-up turns, end the system prompt with "Once you have answered something, treat that answer as done. On later turns, focus your thinking on what the user is asking now, and don't go back over an earlier answer unless the user asks about it or points out a problem with it." Leave it out of long analyses and of agentic tasks where a later step can reveal an earlier mistake; it may also flag its own earlier mistakes less often.
- Remove instructions that ask for the reasoning in the response, including ones that stood in for thinking; such requests can be declined as reasoning extraction. Read summarized thinking instead (a display setting, Outside the prompt).
- The Opus 5 thinking-disabled mitigations target artifacts that appear only with thinking off. Remove any no-thinking rule and re-test whether the combined instruction is still needed.
- Forced tool choice is rejected. Say in the prompt when a tool applies; for schema-valid JSON, use strict tool use or structured outputs.
- Progress updates between tool calls arrive as thinking blocks whose text is empty unless the display setting asks for updates, so a harness that renders only text looks silent (Outside the prompt). It writes fewer updates at higher effort and in long tool chains. Cadence instructions in the system prompt still work, such as a line of intent before the first tool call and a short recap at the end, most usefully where a person follows along. For text the user must see verbatim mid-turn, give it a message tool declared from the first request. A harness can append a turn-scoped reminder after about five quiet tool steps ("The user hasn't heard from you in a while — say in a few words what you're doing, then continue.") and stop after two or three.
- Unattended runs can stop after a progress update that ends the turn. Name the early stops to avoid and the stops you want; Anthropic's example paragraph names four to avoid: a summary that announces the next step without taking it, an offer to continue unless told otherwise, a list of decisions that block nothing, and pausing because the turn was long or a milestone is done. Put it at the end of the system prompt from the first request, keep confirmation for risky actions, leave it out where a person answers, and expect somewhat more tool calls and tokens. Keep open items in a checklist the model updates, wait for background work before treating the task as done, and have the harness send at most two or three continuations.
- It tends to get to work quickly. For agents working across several connected apps on loosely specified tasks, one system-prompt sentence telling it to explore the relevant sources broadly before acting, including ones the task does not mention, completed noticeably more tasks at slightly more tool calls and tokens; keep untrusted content out of what it searches.
- In multi-agent harnesses, have the harness end each message with elapsed time against a budget (`elapsed 340s / 1200s`), or with elapsed time alone plus "Time matters here: do not spend time that can be avoided, and the earlier a correct result is obtained, the better." In Anthropic's research-task evaluations, small teams given either signal finished sooner than a single agent without them. The budget is advisory, so keep a hard timeout; under time pressure it may search and verify a little less.
- Wrap text the user pasted in `<pasted_content id="…">` tags whose opening and closing tags share an app-generated random ID, and add a system-prompt note to follow instructions inside only where the user's own message asks. It can make the model slightly more cautious, and tags can be imitated, so treat it as one guardrail. The system card found the released model still more likely than Opus 5 to act on instructions planted in pasted text (about 2% of attempts at default effort, 7.4% at `max`; Opus 5 never did); with Anthropic's product mitigations it followed none. It resists injection through tool results better than earlier Opus models.
- For frontend work, name the specific styles to avoid, check which styles the first result used instead, and extend the list; a general "avoid a generic AI look" mostly swaps one default for another.
- It reads charts, diagrams, and screenshots more precisely without tools; re-test vision scaffolding built for earlier models. For the densest inputs, higher resolution and crop or zoom tools still help, more so at higher effort; raising effort without tools helps technical drawings but does little for charts.
- Its safety classifiers cover biology, cybersecurity, and reasoning extraction, and a decline arrives as a refusal stop reason; server-side fallback does not retry reasoning-extraction declines. Refusal handling is Outside the prompt.
- Keep the history append-only and change instructions through mid-conversation system messages (Outside the prompt).

Still holds for Opus 5.5, per its sources and the best-practices page that covers it: explicit instructions work best, and "above and beyond" must be asked for; prefill and non-default sampling parameters are rejected; thinking depth is an effort setting, so it goes under Outside the prompt, not into the prompt text; long inputs go first and three to five examples help; "Before you finish, verify against [criteria]" (the page names only Opus 5 as the exception); independent tool calls run in parallel by default, and subagents are used without being told.

Unconfirmed for Opus 5.5: the Opus 5 adjustments for long responses and long written files, narration that needs toning down, over-verification, scope widening, over-delegation, narrated corrections, and literal severity filters in review prompts; and, from the current-generation list, dialling back aggressive language. Anthropic's announcement says its writing is clearer, puts the most important information first, and is much less likely to act outside the boundaries it has been given, and the system card reports its lowest rate of overeager or destructive actions among recent Claude models, but no source says an Opus 5 instruction can go. Test each before keeping or dropping it.

## Claude Opus 5

- Responses run long, and effort controls thinking rather than length. Ask for conciseness explicitly and repeat a short reminder near the end of a long system prompt.
- It narrates readily during agentic work; describe the update cadence you want.
- Files it writes run long; add a length calibration for written deliverables.
- It verifies and self-corrects without being told. Remove verification and re-check instructions carried over from older prompts; they cause over-verification.
- It may widen a task; constrain scope explicitly for narrow tasks.
- It delegates to subagents readily; give explicit delegation rules or cap delegation in the harness.
- It narrates corrections to its own earlier statements; limit that to corrections that change the reader's decisions.
- With thinking disabled it can write a tool call as text or leak internal tags. Keep thinking on at low effort, or add one general instruction that permits a sentence before a tool call and bans internal tags, without naming the tags.
- Review prompts that say "only high-severity issues" are followed literally; ask for everything and filter afterwards.

## Claude Sonnet 5.5

Reviewed 2026-09-29. From Anthropic's Sonnet 5.5 prompting guide, What's new page, migration guide, model page, announcement, and system card, all published at launch on 2026-09-28, and the best-practices page that covers it. Anthropic says Sonnet 5 prompts should perform well unchanged and the Sonnet 5 patterns remain a reasonable starting point, and points to an Opus model for the hardest long-horizon work. Apart from the Sonnet 5 line, no other model's notes carry over: the Opus 5.5 guide does not cover Sonnet 5.5, and the two differ on thinking instructions.

What changes from Sonnet 5, including the Sonnet 5 line under Other current Claude models:

- Effort levels are recalibrated, so a level does not give the same thinking as on Sonnet 5. The API default is `high`; Claude Code and the Claude apps default to `medium`. Under Outside the prompt: start at `high` unless the work is agentic or latency-sensitive, agentic coding and multistep tool use at `medium` for well-specified tasks and `high` for harder or longer ones, chat at `medium` or `low`; reserve `xhigh` and `max` for measured gains; for agentic coding, set `max_tokens` to 128,000 and stream.
- Asking in the system prompt for less thinking does not reliably reduce it; lower effort instead. From `medium` up it thinks briefly before almost every reply; at `low` it skips thinking on most simple requests.
- `disabled` is rejected; the lowest setting, `between_tools`, turns off up-front thinking at `high` effort or below. With it, remove instructions not to think, which make internal XML tags in visible output more likely. Without tools it means no thinking at all, so keep adaptive thinking for reasoning tasks.
- For a JSON answer to a task that needs a few steps of working out, it often answers without thinking, particularly at `low` and `medium`. Prefer structured outputs (Outside the prompt); with them and adaptive thinking, end the system prompt with "Think the problem through before you answer." At `high` this brings accuracy close to `xhigh` for a modest token increase; at `low` and `medium` it helps less and costs more, and `xhigh` alone gives the best accuracy. Without structured outputs it often works the problem out in the text before the JSON, so parse the last JSON value; treat a `max_tokens` stop as failed either way.
- At `low` and `medium` on long agentic tasks it may stop to check in before the work is done. Raise effort first, or add the guide's two-paragraph block: "Keep working until everything the user asked for is done, and only stop to ask when you can't go on without the user or before a risky step.", followed by the stop-and-report paragraph in the next item. Sessions at those levels then run longer and cost more; keep your own rules for risky actions.
- At every effort level, more at higher effort, it tends to add tests, docs, and small supporting files that fit the repository's conventions, while the requested change stays close to the ask; the guide expects most teams to welcome this. To limit changes to what was asked, add the second paragraph on its own: "When the work the user asked for is done and checked, stop and report. Don't add features, tests, files, docs or refactors that weren't asked for. If you think one would help, mention it at the end instead of doing it."
- At `xhigh` and `max` it can start its own rounds of review and verification, sometimes with subagents, and make related fixes. Run routine work at `high` or below, where this is rare, or add the guide's instruction to stop and report once checks pass without extra review rounds or reviewer subagents; in coding tests at `max` it stopped reviewer subagents and cut session cost by about a third with no change in quality, though the main agent's own review rounds still occur, less often.
- On open-ended requests it can start building a presentation, report, or video when you wanted ideas. Say so in the request, or add "When the user asks for ideas, options or a plan, give them that and stop. Don't start building or changing anything until they say to go ahead."
- It generally checks coding work before reporting it done, but at `low` effort it sometimes skips a check that exercises the change. If transcripts show changes reported done without test or build output, add the guide's paragraph requiring a real check (the project's tests, type-checker, or build, or the changed command), installing missing declared dependencies with the project's own package manager and lockfile but never through sudo or the system package manager, and naming any check it could not run; at `low` it made skipped or superficial checks rare at slightly higher cost with no measurable change in quality. Unlike on Opus 5, a verification instruction helps where checks get skipped.
- Notes longer than a sentence or two between tool calls arrive as thinking blocks whose text is empty by default (a display setting, Outside the prompt), and it writes fewer updates at higher effort and in long tool chains. Remove older instructions such as "hold all findings for the final response"; cadence instructions in the system prompt work, most usefully where a person follows along. For exact text the user must see mid-turn, give it a message tool declared from the first request and tell it to use the tool only for such content. A harness can append a one-turn reminder after about five silent steps and stop after the second or third, since frequent harness text after tool results can look like an injection.
- In chat and knowledge work it sometimes answers from training where a search would catch details that have changed. Remove language that discourages tool use, such as "only use tools when strictly necessary" or "minimize tool calls", and, where it has a search tool, add the guide's instruction to check specifics that may have changed "even when you feel confident" and to gather current sources for researched work.
- It sometimes treats a genuine user message that arrives right after tool results as a possible injection. Never put user text inside a tool result, deliver mid-turn input as a user turn with harness notices in a separate system message, and where users can type mid-turn, add no token or budget countdown and no per-step instructions after tool results; task budgets have not been seen to cause this. All of these are harness choices.
- Unlike Sonnet 5, it has no context awareness: the API injects no remaining-budget tags, and the best-practices guidance that pairs context awareness with a compaction-awareness line is written for the context-aware models. Task budgets (beta) give it an explicit budget instead.
- Forced tool choice is rejected, and on Amazon Bedrock structured outputs and strict tool use are unavailable; say in the prompt when a tool applies.
- Remove instructions that ask for the reasoning in the response; they invite reasoning-extraction declines. Read summarized thinking instead.
- For dense charts and technical drawings, give it crop, zoom, or code tools; for charts, tools help at every effort level and more than raising effort, and for drawings only from `high` up.
- Keep the history append-only and change instructions through mid-conversation system messages (Outside the prompt).
- For API deployments that touch child safety or mental health, the system card encourages safety language in the system prompt, like that added on claude.ai.

Still holds for Sonnet 5.5, per its sources and the best-practices page that covers it: explicit instructions work best; saying in the prompt when a tool applies is how to get a tool called; prefill and non-default sampling parameters are rejected; long inputs go first and three to five examples help; independent tool calls run in parallel by default, a targeted nudge raises the rate, and early testers found it batched tool calls more than Sonnet 5; subagents are used without being told.

Unconfirmed for Sonnet 5.5: literal instruction following as a stated trait, which the unrequested additions and open-ended building above partly contradict; tool use with up-front thinking off; formatting and markdown defaults; response length and tone (the system card reports shorter, less verbose outputs than Sonnet 5 only in its suicide, self-harm, and disordered-eating sections, and the announcement says it writes more clearly than the previous generation); dialling back aggressive language; how readily it delegates the task itself at default effort; and prompting for frontend design, code-review harnesses, and computer use, which the Sonnet 5 guide covered and the Sonnet 5.5 guide does not. The system card reports substantially fewer instruction-following failures than Sonnet 5, but no source says a Sonnet 5 instruction can go.

## Claude Fable 5.1 and Mythos 5.1

- Fewer user-facing updates during long tool-calling turns. Remove any line that suppresses narration, then add a cadence line stating when to speak and what each update contains.
- In coding and computer-use loops it may issue one tool call per turn; a one-sentence batching nudge at the end of each tool-result turn fixes it.
- Keep the conversation history append-only; edits before a preserved thinking block fail or drop the block. Per-turn reminders go at the end of the newest turn.
- Prose can run dense; an instruction to drop mannered phrasing, or simply "remove all mannered prose", helps.
- It formats less than earlier models; replace anti-formatting blocks with a rule that says when lists and headings are appropriate.
- Summaries may reproduce source wording unmarked; one complete example with a rationale line fixes it better than a rule.
- On long autonomous work it may end the turn early or ask permission for requested work; use the autonomy block and the scope block from the agent tasks reference, together.
- Tell a client-side compaction summarizer what to preserve.
- It sometimes fixes nearby code or commits extra test files; the keep-changes-to-the-task instruction removes most of it.
- At low effort it answers from memory more often; add the search-before-answering line or raise effort for that turn.
- Safeguard false positives: ask "are there bugs in this program" rather than "does it compile", give context for obscure languages, and remove base64 from tool output.
- It may rewrite whole files for small changes; ask for targeted edits.
- At the two highest effort levels a long deliverable can be drafted twice, in reasoning and again in the reply; append the note that reasoning and output share one token limit and that drafting twice is wasted.
- An effort sweep on your own evaluations is the primary cost control; level names do not mean the same depth across models.

## Other current Claude models

- Sonnet 5, Opus 4.8, Sonnet 4.6: literal instruction following; plain "use this tool when…" triggers tools appropriately; context awareness pairs well with a compaction-awareness line in compacting harnesses.
- Opus 4.6: more upfront exploration; replace blanket defaults with targeted tool instructions; a commit-to-an-approach line curbs re-deliberation; damp subagent use explicitly.
- Haiku 4.5: benefits from more guidance and examples than the larger models; test the prompt on it separately.

## GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6.1 Sol, GPT-6 Sol, and GPT-6 Luna

Reviewed 2026-09-29. OpenAI's GPT-6 guide gives one set of prompts for the whole family. They address behaviour observed on GPT-6 Astra (released 2026-09-03), so they apply to Astra directly; for GPT-6.1 Sol (released 2026-09-29), GPT-6 Sol, and GPT-6 Luna (both released 2026-09-22) the guide offers them as a starting point to evaluate with your model and workload. OpenAI's Astra post adds the other direction: guidance that helps Sol or Luna may overconstrain Astra. Everything below except the model roles, the API settings, and the GPT-6.1 Sol system card findings was observed on Astra. OpenAI publishes no prompting guidance specific to GPT-6.1 Sol, GPT-6 Sol, or Luna.

Astra is OpenAI's most capable model, built for the hardest end-to-end work; the ChatGPT Models page says to give it the sources, templates, constraints, and checks that define a useful result. GPT-6.1 Sol, the newer Sol model, gives near-Astra performance at a lower cost for complex coding, computer use, and professional work; OpenAI suggests comparing it with Astra on your own tasks, and Codex recommends it for complex coding and agentic workflows. GPT-6 Sol is built for complex coding and agentic workflows. Luna is the family's most efficient model, for focused, high-volume tasks; the ChatGPT Models page names extraction, classification, transformation, and structured summaries. OpenAI's model-selection guides for the API and for ChatGPT Work and Codex suggest Luna at low effort for fine-grained edits, well-scoped problem-solving, and simple data extraction.

API settings, all under Outside the prompt:

- Effort: Astra and GPT-6.1 Sol support `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`; neither supports `none` (on Astra it returns HTTP 400), and the guide says to use `low` instead. GPT-6.1 Sol does not support `minimal` either, and defaults to `medium`. GPT-6 Sol and Luna support `none` through `max`, with `medium` as the default. A request that used `minimal` starts at `low`. OpenAI's API pages state no default for Astra; for ChatGPT and Codex, OpenAI suggests starting Astra at Light, which is `low`, and notes that effort levels do not map exactly between model generations.
- Tools: Astra and GPT-6.1 Sol support Chat Completions, but tool calling needs the Responses API. GPT-6 Sol and Luna support function calling in Chat Completions only at effort `none`; reasoning with tools needs Responses.
- With effort above `none`, remove `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_logprobs`, and also `logprobs` in Chat Completions or `message.output_text.logprobs` from `include` in Responses. Astra has no `none`, so this applies to every Astra request.
- To change effort mid-conversation without losing the prompt cache, the harness adds a `configuration_update` item rather than changing the request-level effort. It works in standard, single-agent mode, and not together with automatic compaction or truncation.

What changes from GPT-5.x, observed on Astra:

- Eagerness now needs pushing the other way: the model asks clarifying questions where earlier models assumed, asks non-blocking questions while it works, and may stop for review after a first implementation. Add a bias-to-action instruction (infer intent and scope, treat "can you…" as a request to act, persist until the intended goal is done), ask for approval only once a concrete, reviewable result exists, and put running, inspecting, and fixing into the definition of done. The guide's approval block also rules out unsolicited warnings, disclaimers, approval flows, and compliance checklists over hypothetical risk. Tune these to the autonomy the application needs.
- Soften strong ask-first boundaries written for earlier models; they can stop the work. A required stop for review after the first implementation pulls it toward an earlier stop, so keep one only where that decision is needed. For a workflow known to be safe, such as a local test suite with disposable fixtures, grant standing permission in AGENTS.md. To keep it exploring past a first pass, say what to explore and where to stop.
- OpenAI's pages frame the questioning two ways. The guide's Astra overview and the ChatGPT Models page present it as a strength: Astra fills routine gaps from context and asks focused questions when the answer could change the outcome. The guide's prompting section and the Astra post treat the same tendency as a cause of early stops.
- It follows longer instructions better but is more sensitive to what is in context: unclear or conflicting guidance in a skill or AGENTS.md can make it pause early. State that the user's instructions take precedence over skill guidance, and audit the instruction files it can read. To trace a pause, the guide's prompt asks it to name the SKILL.md it read, quote the instruction, and separate explicit requirements from its interpretation. Overly specific, recipe-style guidance can now hinder results. The Astra post also advises short skill descriptions that say when to use the skill, a root file that routes to supporting docs for a skill with several workflows, and AGENTS.md pointers that say when each doc applies rather than requiring it before every edit.
- It tends to detailed responses with lists, tables, and Markdown, and to recurring stock phrases. State the style and structure you want; the guide offers a prose-first instruction, a plain-language instruction for technical communication, and a list of phrases to avoid.
- On coding tasks it tests and checks its work unprompted; test and verification instructions written for earlier models cause unnecessary testing. Calibrate instead: no tests for reversible, low-impact changes that mirror the implementation, and broader testing only when failures or new changes justify it.
- It may delegate less than wanted; in a multi-agent harness, say when and how much to use subagents. Messages between agents may contain grammar or spacing errors; the guide adds a line asking for legible messages with proper spacing. GPT-6.1 Sol supports multi-agent delegation in the Responses API, in beta.

GPT-6.1 Sol's system card addendum reports OpenAI's evaluations of that model, not prompting guidance. Its HealthBench answers ran longer than GPT-6 Sol's and Luna's and slightly shorter than Astra's; no source says whether that holds outside health questions. When a warning blocked a routine action, it kept trying to get around the warning in 23.5% of rollouts against 17.4% for Astra, in an evaluation run without system-level controls. Against Astra it also drew more reward-hacking and concealed-uncertainty flags in a simulated Codex deployment, and misrepresented its work more often on coding tasks chosen to elicit it (1.50% against 0.51%). No source says whether prompt text changes any of these.

Still holds from GPT-5.x, per the GPT-6 sources: effort is a request parameter; instructions are followed closely, and conflicting ones now cost more.

Unconfirmed for the whole family: brief tool preambles, concrete length constraints, re-anchoring claims in long inputs, labelled assumptions, the JSON schema with `null` for missing values, citations and contradiction resolution, and identical prompts when resuming after compaction. Also unconfirmed: whether the verbosity setting applies, Astra's API default effort, how to prompt GPT-6 Sol and Luna for reasoning at effort `none`, any behaviour observed on GPT-6.1 Sol, GPT-6 Sol, or Luna beyond the system card findings above, whether the Astra-derived prompts help or overconstrain them, and which prompt changes a move from GPT-6 Sol to GPT-6.1 Sol needs: the guide's migration steps cover API settings and point to its initiative prompts for approval pauses.

## GPT-5.x

From the GPT-5, 5.1, and 5.2 prompting guides at review.

- Reasoning effort is a request parameter; keep it out of the prompt text.
- Agentic eagerness is tunable. For less, set explicit context-gathering budgets and tool-call limits and say when to stop searching; for more, add persistence instructions.
- Ask for brief tool preambles: a short plan before calls and one-line updates at phase changes, not narration of routine calls.
- Give concrete length constraints; explicitly forbid unrequested features and styling.
- On long inputs, ask for key sections to be summarized and claims re-anchored to document regions.
- Ask for labelled assumptions and plausible interpretations instead of fabricated detail.
- For extraction, supply a JSON schema with required and optional fields and `null` for missing values.
- Ask for citations on web-derived claims and explicit resolution of contradictions.
- Keep prompts functionally identical when resuming a compacted workflow.
- Instructions are followed closely, so contradictory instructions cost more than on older models; remove conflicts before adding rules.

## Gemini 3.x

- System instructions and role first, then context, then the specific task.
- Keep sampling parameters at their defaults.
- Thinking is built in; drop redundant "plan first" requests.
- Keep formatting consistent across few-shot examples.
- Use the grounding tools for current facts and code execution for calculation rather than asking the model to compute in text.
- Request the output format explicitly (table, list, JSON).

## Grok 4.7

Reviewed 2026-09-29. xAI publishes no text-prompting guide for Grok 4.7 or any Grok 4.x model, so these lines record what its model page, API documentation, and launch post state. Apply the portable core and test on the model.

- Reasoning is always on and cannot be disabled. Its depth is the `reasoning_effort` setting: `low`, `medium`, `high` (the default), or `xhigh`. List the depth under Outside the prompt. xAI does not say whether step-by-step wording in the prompt helps or hurts.
- Stop sequences and presence and frequency penalties return an error on xAI's reasoning models, Grok 4.7 included. A draft that relies on a stop sequence needs output tags or a structured output instead.
- xAI says it works longer on difficult tasks and checks its own work more carefully than Grok 4.6. Whether an explicit verification instruction still helps is unconfirmed.
- Parallel function calling is on by default.
- With structured outputs, a response is guaranteed to match the supported schema features, so the prompt can describe the task without restating the required fields.
- Inline citations are on by default in the Responses API, but the model decides when to cite; they do not guarantee a citation on every answer.
- For cache hits, keep system prompt, few-shot examples, and reference documents at the start as a stable prefix and only append to the history. The cache key, passing reasoning items back unchanged, and context compaction for long agent loops are harness settings for Outside the prompt.
- For Grok Build rule files such as AGENTS.md (Grok 4.7 is Grok Build's default model), xAI says short, specific instructions are followed more reliably than long ones.

Unconfirmed for Grok 4.7: response to instruction style and emphasis, verbosity and length (no verbosity setting is documented), formatting defaults, persistence and progress updates on agentic work, delegation, few-shot examples, prefill, question placement in long inputs, and changes needed when migrating prompts from Grok 4.6.

## Unknown or other

Apply the portable core only and say so in the report. A prompt tuned for one family's quirks can underperform on another.
